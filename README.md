# Big Market Sales Data: Transformation and Distribution Analysis

Welcome to the Big Market Sales Data: Transformation and Distribution Analysis repository! This Jupyter notebook explores the Big Market Sales dataset, providing insights into data transformation techniques and distribution analysis. Leveraging Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, the notebook covers visualization methods and transformations to enhance data distributions.

## Tasks Overview

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis

- **Distribution Plot:** Utilized Seaborn to create a distribution plot showcasing the distribution of sales in the dataset.

### 2. Transformation Techniques

- **Skewness Calculation:** Computed skewness to understand the asymmetry of the sales distribution.
- **QQ Plot:** Employed a Quantile-Quantile plot to assess if the sales data follows a particular theoretical distribution.

### 3. Various Transformations

- **Log Transformation:** Applied log transformation to mitigate right skewness in the sales distribution.
- **Square Transformation:** Explored square transformation to handle left skewness in the temperature data.
- **Box-Cox Transformation:** Demonstrated Box-Cox transformation for flexible handling of skewness.
- **Yeo-Johnson Transformation:** Utilized the Yeo-Johnson transformation for improved normalization.

## Usage

Explore the notebook sequentially to understand the impact of different transformations on the sales and temperature distributions. Code snippets, visualizations, and explanations are provided to aid your understanding. Feel free to modify and experiment with the code for further learning.
